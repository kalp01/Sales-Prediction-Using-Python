This Sales challenge, is a regression problem wherein we have to predict product-wise and store-wise sales.
Sales prediction is a very common real-life problem that each company faces at-least once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can have a significant impact on the success and performance of that company.According to a study, companies with accurate sales predictions are 10% more likely to grow their revenue year-over-year and 7.3% more likely to hit quota.

Problem Statement:
The data scientists at Retail Stroes have collected sales data across 10 stores in different cities for the year 2013. Now each product has certain attributes that sets it apart from other products. Same is the case with each store.
The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store so that it would help the decision makers at BigMart to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales.
